CP3402 Week 1 Reflection
1. Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I decided that my startup theme would be my own guitar studio. After finalizing the theme, I created a preliminary design for my website, including three key pages: Home, About, and Contact. Ideally, I plan to expand it to five pages by adding a Classes section and a Buy section to offer customers a more comprehensive set of services.
To begin, I reviewed some of the content from CP1406 on LearnJCU, which helped refresh my understanding of basic HTML structures, such as how to format pages and insert images. Additionally, I explored how to use CSS to enhance the design and layout of my HTML files. Below are the resources I referred to during the process:
•	Learn CSS Basics: Runoob (A Chinese resource for easier comprehension)
•	CSS Reference: W3Schools
These resources were particularly helpful for improving my understanding of CSS and how it works with HTML.
2. Estimated Hours
This week, I spent a total of seven hours on practical tasks:
•	Four hours were dedicated to designing and modifying my web pages.
•	Three hours were spent browsing materials and learning CSS.
3. Content Insights
Choosing the guitar studio theme was a great way to ease into web design. While working on the website, I gained a better understanding of how tools like WordPress work. I learned that WordPress is built on PHP and MySQL, and its open-source nature (licensed under GPLv2) allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute it freely.
I also explored PHP, an open-source server-side scripting language widely used for web development. PHP scripts execute on the server to dynamically generate content for web pages. While learning about WordPress and PHP, I realized that strong foundational knowledge in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS is essential, as these technologies are still heavily utilized.
This week’s learning has improved my self-learning skills and given me a clearer understanding of how to approach projects step by step.
4. Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing this week’s practical, I explored some online resources and learning courses about guitar studio websites on platforms like YouTube and Bilibili. My goal was to gather inspiration and guidance for my web design. These resources not only gave me new design ideas but also taught me some advanced CSS techniques, which I believe will enhance my ability to add more details to my websites.
However, I realized that this learning approach is not always efficient. For example, a 30-minute video might only provide five minutes of relevant information. To save time, I think it’s better to seek solutions to specific problems as they arise, which would make the learning process more targeted and efficient.
This week has been a productive start to the project, and I’m looking forward to applying these new skills to further improve my website.
