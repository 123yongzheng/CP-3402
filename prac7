For this week, I focused on learning PHP by developing a simple web application. I used XAMPP as my local development environment, which provided an all-in-one solution with Apache, MySQL, and PHP. To gain a better understanding of PHP fundamentals, I explored official PHP documentation and various online resources.

This week, I implemented key PHP functionalities such as echo, if/else statements, loops (foreach), functions, and include for code reuse. I created a simple suggestion submission website that allowed users to input and view suggestions. Instead of using a database, I experimented with file handling to store user-submitted data. This approach provided insight into basic data persistence methods in PHP. Additionally, I encountered security concerns such as XSS vulnerabilities, which I mitigated using htmlspecialchars().
Understanding PHP fundamentals has strengthened my backend development skills, which are essential for web development careers. I also realized the importance of security best practices when handling user input. Moving forward, I plan to deepen my knowledge of PHP frameworks and database integration to build more dynamic web applications.
